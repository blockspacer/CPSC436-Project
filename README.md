# CPSC436-Project (Panda Express)
A UBC Course Project (CPSC 436D) worked on during 2018 Winter Term 2. It is a video game built from scratch
without the use of any external game engines. The video game is an infinite runner involving 
both horizontal/vertical scrolling gameplay. We offer a detailed story mode comprised of vertical/horizontal and a boss level
alongside endless modes which will put your skills to the ultimate test.
